# Development Request: Calendar UI for Practice Level Selection Screen

## Executive Summary
Request to replace the current practice level selection screen with a calendar-based UI to enhance user engagement and learning consistency through visual progress tracking.

## Background & Objective
The current list-based practice selection interface lacks visual motivation and doesn't effectively encourage daily learning habits. A calendar UI will provide immediate visual feedback on learning patterns, similar to GitHub's contribution graph, which has proven highly effective in maintaining user engagement.

## Business Value
- **Increased User Retention**: Visual progress tracking encourages daily app usage
- **Enhanced Motivation**: Streak tracking and visual achievements drive continued learning
- **Improved User Experience**: Intuitive date-based navigation for accessing practice sessions
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Clear visualization of learning patterns for users

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Calendar Display
- **Monthly View**: Display current month with ability to navigate previous/next months
- **Visual Status Indicators**:
  - Completed days (all 10 questions solved): Green background
  - Perfect score days (10/10 correct): Gold background with star icon
  - In-progress days (partially completed): Orange background
  - Not attempted: Default white
  - Future dates: Grayed out or locked appearance
  - Today: Blue border highlight

### 2. Progress Tracking Dashboard
Display key metrics at the top of the screen:
- **Current Streak**: Consecutive days of learning (with flame icon)
- **Longest Streak**: Historical best record (with trophy icon)
- **Total Study Days**: Overall learning days count (with book icon)

### 3. Interactive Features
- **Date Selection**: Tap any date to view details in a modal/bottom sheet
  - Show completion status (e.g., "6/10 questions completed")
  - Display accuracy rate for completed sessions
  - Provide action buttons: "Continue", "Retry", or "Start" based on status
- **Quick Navigation**: "Today" button to jump to current date
- **Smart CTA Button**: Bottom button that dynamically changes based on today's progress:
  - "Start Today's Practice" (not started)
  - "Continue Practice (6/10)" (in progress)  
  - "Today's Practice Complete âœ“" (finished)

### 4. Data Requirements
Each calendar date should store:
- Question completion count (solved/total)
- Accuracy data (correct/total)
- Timestamp of last activity
- Session duration (optional)

## Visual Design Specifications

### Color Palette
- **Completed**: #4CAF50 (Green)
- **Perfect Score**: #FFC107 (Amber/Gold)
- **In Progress**: #FF9800 (Orange)
- **Not Started**: #FFFFFF (White)
- **Locked/Future**: #E0E0E0 (Light Gray)
- **Today Indicator**: #2196F3 (Blue)
- **Selected Date**: #9C27B0 (Purple)

### Streak Statistics Card
- Gradient background (suggested: blue to purple)
- White text with semi-transparent containers
- Elevated card design with subtle shadow

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy load historical data (only load visible months)
- Cache calendar data locally for offline access
- Smooth animations for month transitions

### State Management
- Persist learning data across sessions
- Real-time updates when returning from practice sessions
- Handle timezone considerations for international users

## Success Metrics
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)** increase by 20%
- **Average streak length** improvement
- **User retention rate** at Day 7 and Day 30
- **Practice completion rate** increase

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic calendar view with status colors
- Current/longest streak display
- Date selection with practice navigation

### Phase 2
- Animated transitions
- Achievement badges for milestones
- Weekly/monthly goals setting

### Phase 3
- Advanced analytics view
- Push notifications for streak maintenance

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks

## Dependencies
- Calendar UI library evaluation (e.g., table_calendar for Flutter)
- Database schema updates for streak tracking
- Analytics integration for metrics tracking

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex date/time handling across timezones
- **Mitigation**: Establish clear timezone policy (use user's local time)

- **Risk**: Performance issues with large historical data
- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and data virtualization
