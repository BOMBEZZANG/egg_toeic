2. Log in with your Google account
3. Select your project from the list

**Can't find your project?**

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Authentication

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Authentication"**
   - It has a 🔐 icon
   - Should be near the top of the menu

2. **If this is your first time:**

### Step 3: Enable Anonymous Sign-in

1. Click the **"Sign-in method"** tab at the top
   - You'll see a list of authentication providers

2. Find **"Anonymous"** in the list
   - It should be near the top
   - Status will show "Disabled"

3. Click on the **"Anonymous"** row
   - A dialog will pop up

4. Toggle the **"Enable"** switch to ON
   - It will turn blue/green when enabled

5. Click **"Save"** button

**✅ Success!**
- "Anonymous" should now show status: **"Enabled"**

---

### Step 4: Verify Setup

**Check 1: Sign-in Methods**
- Go back to Authentication → Sign-in method
- Verify "Anonymous" shows "Enabled" ✅

**Check 2: Try Your App**
```bash
flutter run
```

**Check 3: Look for These Logs**

## 🎓 Understanding Anonymous Authentication

### What is it?
- Temporary user account
- Created automatically
- No email/password needed
- Unique ID (UID) assigned

### What gets stored?
**In Firebase Console → Authentication:**
- User ID (UID): `Kx7mN2pQ8rZ3sT5vW9y`
- Provider: Anonymous
- Created date
- Last sign-in date

**In Firebase Console → Firestore:**
- User data organized by UID
- `users/{UID}/progress/current`
- `userAnswers` with user's UID
- `questionAnalytics` (shared)

### How long does it last?
- **Persists:** Until app uninstall
- **Survives:** App updates, phone restarts
- **Same ID:** Across app launches
- **New ID:** Only on fresh install

### Can it be upgraded?
- **Yes!** Future Phase 2 feature
- Can link to Google, Apple, Kakao accounts
- Same UID maintained after upgrade
- No data loss
