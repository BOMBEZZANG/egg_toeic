# ❌ Wrong Answers Feature - Firestore Sync Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your Egg TOEIC app now **saves wrong answers to Firestore**! 🎉

Previously: Only saved locally (Hive)
Now: Saved to both Hive + Firestore ✅

## 📊 How Wrong Answers are Stored

### Local Storage (Hive)
**Location:** Device storage
**Format:** List of WrongAnswer objects

### Cloud Storage (Firestore)
**Location:** `users/{userId}/wrongAnswers/{wrongAnswerId}`

**Each Document Contains:**
```json
{
  "id": "wrong_P5_L1_001_1642723456",
  "questionId": "P5_L1_001",
  "questionText": "She ___ to Paris twice.",
  "options": ["go", "goes", "went", "has gone"],
  "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
  "selectedAnswerIndex": 1,
  "explanation": "Use 'has gone' for present perfect tense.",
  "grammarPoint": "Present Perfect",
  "difficultyLevel": 1,
  "answeredAt": "2025-01-20T10:30:00.000Z",
  "isResolved": false,
  "reviewedAt": null,
  "attemptCount": 1,
  "userId": "Kx7mN2pQ8rZ3sT5vW9y",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-20T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 📱 User Experience

### Scenario 1: Normal Usage
```
Day 1: User answers 5 questions wrong
       → 5 documents created in Firestore ✅
       → Saved locally in Hive ✅

Day 2: User reviews wrong answers
       → Gets 2 correct
       → Those 2 marked as resolved in Firestore ✅
       → Still in list but marked resolved
```

### Scenario 2: App Reinstall
```
Day 1: User has 10 wrong answers
       → Saved to Firestore ✅

Day 2: User uninstalls app 😱

Day 3: User reinstalls app
       → Authentication restores same UID ✅
       → Loads 10 wrong answers from Firestore ✅
       → User's wrong answer history is back! 🎉
```

### Scenario 3: Offline Usage
```
User goes offline 📵
User answers 3 questions wrong
       → Saved to Hive ✅
       → Firestore sync skipped (offline)

User goes back online 📶
User answers another question wrong
       → Saved to Hive ✅
       → ALL 4 synced to Firestore ✅ (including 3 from offline)
```

---

## 🔍 What Data Gets Saved

### Full Question Data
✅ Question text
✅ All 4 options
✅ Correct answer index
✅ User's selected answer index
✅ Explanation
✅ Grammar point

### Metadata
✅ Question ID
✅ Difficulty level
✅ When answered
✅ Resolution status
✅ Review timestamp
✅ Attempt count

### Why Save Full Data?
- **No re-fetching:** User can review offline
- **Faster loading:** No need to query questions collection
- **Complete history:** Even if question is deleted from main DB
- **Better UX:** Instant display of wrong answers

---

## 💾 Data Size Considerations

### Typical Wrong Answer Document
```
~1-2 KB per wrong answer
```

### Example Storage Usage
- 10 wrong answers = ~15 KB
- 50 wrong answers = ~75 KB
- 100 wrong answers = ~150 KB

**Firestore Free Tier:**
- 1 GB storage total
- Can store millions of wrong answers!

---

## 🔒 Security

### Firestore Security Rules

Already configured:
```javascript
match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
                       request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Users can only access their own wrong answers
- ✅ Anonymous users can access their wrong answers
- ❌ Users cannot see others' wrong answers
- ✅ Private and secure
